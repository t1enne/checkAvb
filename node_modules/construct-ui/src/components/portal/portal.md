@# Portal

A portal mounts its children to a `div` element that is appended to `document.body` (or a container element if specified). This is useful for UI related components such as overlays, popovers, dropdowns, etc. where rendering inline would cause CSS overflow/z-index issues.

@# Portal Attrs
